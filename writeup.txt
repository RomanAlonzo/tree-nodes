2. There are currently 5 errors that I have in my code, four of which come from the BuildTree method from the use of my MultiKeyMap variable "distance", 
where things get messy when I try to use math and type conversion on spots which require using distance. The other error is on the method
findTreeNodeByLabel, where I try to call descendents from the method, but since its static that can't happen. I've been confused about this one,
because to find a label you need to pass in a node, but the static nature prevents such outreach.
3. I think loadSpeciesFile has the potential to be time ineficient, since I have so many loops going on it's possible something gets hung up for a bit.
I think toTreeString has the potential to be space innefficient if my dot counters are off and it prints way too many periods.
4. BuildTree was definately the most challenging, the pdf didn't offer much good direction so I had to call my friends to talk through some processes 
and get help from mentors to get it going. Also loadSpeciesFile took me way longer than I thought it would, that was definately the next hardest part.
toString took me a while to get solid progress on because I kept running into roadblocks.
5. For testing, I had my friend help me setup Intellij to have Program2 as its configuration, so when I ran my PhyloTree.java it would give me results.
I also made a text file called test1 that had the directory location to the sample output so I could do comparisons.
6. I heard previous years did this in groups! Oh well who needs friends anyway.
